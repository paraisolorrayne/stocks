# Stock App

This project is a mobile application for managing and viewing a portfolio of stocks. It allows users to view the current stock prices and details for individual stocks.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Stock App, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Flutter (latest version)
- Dart (latest version)
- A preferred IDE (e.g., Android Studio, VS Code, IntelliJ)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paraisolorrayne/stock_app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd stock_app
```

3. Fetch all the dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

4. Run the app:

```bash
flutter run
```

## Usage

After launching the app, log in with the credentials to view the stock portfolio. Tap on a stock to view its detailed information.

```bash
user: john@example.com
password: password
```

## Built With

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) - The UI toolkit used
- [Bloc](https://bloclibrary.dev/) - State management

Certainly, here is an additional section for your `README.md` that explains the use of the Bloc pattern with a repository in your project:

```markdown
## Architecture

This project follows the [Bloc Pattern](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/) for state management, ensuring a clear separation between the presentation layer and business logic.

### Bloc with Repository

The Bloc (Business Logic Component) pattern is used in conjunction with a repository pattern to provide a clean architecture framework that facilitates testability and reusability of code.

#### How it works:

- **Repositories** are responsible for fetching data from one or more sources (e.g., network, local storage). They abstract the origin of the data from the Blocs.
- **Blocs** consume the repositories to perform actions, handle state changes, and expose states to the UI layer.
- **Events** are input to Blocs that trigger any state changes.
- **States** are output from Blocs that represent a part of the UI at a particular point in time.

This architecture allows for a reactive and predictable state management approach where the UI can respond to state changes in real-time.

### Advantages

- **Separation of Concerns**: By decoupling the business logic from the UI, the app becomes easier to maintain and scale.
- **Testability**: Blocs and Repositories can be easily mocked and tested, ensuring more reliable code.
- **Reactivity**: Bloc allows for a reactive paradigm where the UI updates automatically in response to state changes.
- **Developer Experience**: With clear patterns and separation, new developers can quickly understand the codebase and contribute effectively.

For more information on Bloc and its usage in Flutter, refer to the official [Bloc documentation](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/).
```

## To-Do

This project is a work in progress, and there are several enhancements and features planned for future development. Here are some of the upcoming tasks:

### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Implement unit tests for all Blocs to ensure each state transition is occurring as expected.
- **Widget Tests**: Develop widget tests to guarantee that the UI components are rendering properly for each state.
- **Integration Tests**: Set up integration tests to verify the entire workflow from the UI to the data layer.

### Features
- **User Authentication**: Enhance the user authentication flow to include more security features like OAuth, two-factor authentication, etc.
- **Portfolio Analytics**: Add advanced analytics features to give users insights into their portfolio performance.
- **Real-time Updates**: Implement real-time stock updates using WebSockets or similar technologies.
- **Dark Mode**: Introduce a dark mode theme for the application for enhanced user experience in low-light conditions.

### Refactoring
- **Code Cleanup**: Refactor existing code to improve readability and performance.
- **State Management Optimization**: Optimize state management to handle more complex scenarios and reduce boilerplate code.

### Documentation
- **Code Documentation**: Ensure that all the methods and classes are well documented for easier maintenance.
- **User Guide**: Create a comprehensive user guide for end-users to navigate through the application features.

### CI/CD
- **Pipeline**: Set up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the testing and deployment process.

Contributions to help accomplish these tasks are welcomed. Please feel free to fork the repository, complete a task, and submit a pull request.
